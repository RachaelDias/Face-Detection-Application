# Face Detection and Identification Application
The main objective of this project is to implement Face Detection and Recognition using the OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) library. The project is divided into 3 phases face detection, training the recognizer and facial recognition. The first phase involves being able to detect faces by applying a classifier. In the second phase, a recognizer model is trained on a set of images. The third and final phase involves applying the recognizer to real-time streaming data either from a webcam or on videos.
